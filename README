The Integrated Earth System Model

The Integrated Earth System Model (iESM) couples the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) to the Community Earth System Model (CESM). See Collins et al. (2015) for a complete technical documentation.

Please note further development on this model is not planned at this time. Future couplings between GCAM and ESMs will be via the ACME project on a separate repository. This code is provided with no support.
