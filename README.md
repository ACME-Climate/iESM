# The Integrated Earth System Model (iESM)The Integrated Earth System Model (iESM) couples the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM, www.globalchange.umd.edu/gcam) to the Community Earth System Model (CESM, http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/). The iESM represents a major new model capability that permits the exploration of process-level interactions among human and Earth systems that were previously not represented in the existing suite of computational tools and procedures. The initial version of the iESM focuses on carbon cycle interactions (see Figure), with the models exchanging information about land use, land cover, land productivity, and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. See Collins et al. (2015) for a complete technical documentation and Thornton et al. (2017) for an example of an analysis using iESM.*iESM Coupling Schematic*![iESM Schematic](./iESM_Schematic.png)Please note further development on this model is not planned at this time. Future couplings between GCAM and ESMs will be via the ACME project on a separate repository. We anticipate releasing the GCAM-ACME coupled code with ACME version 2.  This code is provided with no support. If you do have questions or comments, we suggest using GitHub issues, but we do not guarantee prompt responses.## Using the iESMWe have created a User’s Guide to facilitate use of the model code. If you use the iESM in a publication, we suggest citing `Collins et al. (2015)` (below). Additionally, we suggest the following acknowledgment: “The development of the iESM was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research.”## Selected ReferencesCollins, W.
